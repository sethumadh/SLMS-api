My requirement is now different. The student will enroll to a subject in a term and not subjectGroup or the levels in a subject. The student should be able to enroll for multiple subjects across any
subject in a term and these subjects can belong to different subjectgroup.

The student is charged a fee based on which subject group he belongs to. WHihc means , A student can take as many subjects in a subjectgroup and will be charged only a flat fee for the subject group.
FOr example, Term 1 , of 6 months period, has two subject groups. Group 1 contains one subject called music , having levels L1 and L2 and fee for the group is 200 and is mothly charged Second subject
group called group 2 , contains three subjects called maths , english, biology , each having levels L1 and L2 and L3 and fee for the group is 100 and is charged every three months.

A student called bob can enroll to music and maths and english and will be charged 200+100 = 300

So the fee payable by bob for music is monthly, since group 1 os monthly charged and for maths and english is paid every 3 months sinc group 2 is charged 3 months.

So bob should be charged fee and fee payable amount and due date based on subject group. But bob should be enrolled to a subject in a term . enrolling bob to a subject in a term will enure the teacher
to give feedback for bob for a subject in a term.

Now suggest what modifictaion is to be made in my schema. for enrollment , fee, termsubject and any other tables/models to be modified.

Bob can also enroll in term 2 , and can enroll for group 2 for maths and english . Which means admin should be able to query historical data for bob in term 1 . So which means term should be
considered along with subjects for enrolling bob right?
